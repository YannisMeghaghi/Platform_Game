# Platform_Game

This little project is a personnal project that i did in order to get the basics in Unity.
I just wanted to make a platform gameat the beginning without ennemies, to understand how collisions and animations work.
I may work on it later to add ennemies and maybe other levels.

PS: The animations are not mine i downloaded them on https://itch.io/game-assets/free.
